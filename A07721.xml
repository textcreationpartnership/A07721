         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that the glory of Princes can be by none more highly aduaunced, their Armyes more inuincibly fenced, or their Enimies more ſpeedily ſubuerted. Hence it is, that Antiquity, named them <hi>Iumenta,</hi> as the chiefe Adiume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta or helpes of humane nature, that by the very name, the nobleneſſe, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry vſe and profite of them might be knowen, and the diuiſion betwixt the Noble and Worthy, Baſe and Vnworthy, manifeſted in fit difference: Wherevnto, none, onely the Learned and generall practiſe of all former Ages, but more particularly, the Statute-Lawes of this your Royall Kingdome of England do ſubſcribe: recording them to be the maintenance of the ſtrength &amp; preſeruation of euery Kingdome: Without them, the pride of the Enemy, wanting no boldneſſe to attempt, cannot but bring dishonor and detryment to Prince and Countrey. So that man cannot be ſo much ſeruaunt to his owne conceit, or ſo iniurious to ſuch ſeruiceable Deſerts, but that he muſt acknowledge, not onely the Excellency, but
<pb facs="tcp:10570:3"/>alſo the neceſſity of a Creature (by inſeperable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity) ſo lincked vnto him, that with it no Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme is vnpoſſible, and without it, the leaſt exployt hardly accompliſhed. Now, although this your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and flouriſhing kingdome be ſo fortunate in bleſſings, as neuer to haue deaffed any eares of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Countreyes, with ſupplication for aſſiſtance, yet foraſmuch as all good Races and breed of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are therein ſo decayed, that neither the true ſhape of their primary creation, neyther their perfect and right maner of their breeding, &amp; preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, neither the knowledge of their natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyties (without proofe &amp; practiſe) is by fewe or none diſcerned, neither by writing or practiſe fore opened, (without which, that olde Chiualry of our Engliſh Nation cannot be continued) &amp; thereby Error and Ignorance (two inſeperable Twinnes of this Age) through Cuſtome (the Tyrant of all Ages,) more predomynate, then was the palpable darkeneſſe of Egypt. Who is not afrayed leaſt the idle delightes and delicacies of this inuerted &amp; infected Age, (the firſt ſeedes of ſubuerſions of all Kingdomes) make your Subiectes degenerate from their Aunceſtors happy care in this kind? ſeeing the Learned forbeare to practiſe, and the Practiſers forbeare to ſtudy: each man reſpecting his bred-conceit and owne priuate end, more then their Mother, the Common-weale: the trueth wherof al mens eyes depoſe.

For if by condition they meane his good or bad action, and the goodnes of his worke &amp; qualitie, then is their propoſition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vntrue: for euery creature worketh according to his nature, and all learning doth deny, that complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nature are in all parts one and the ſame: for the learned doe know that the temperature of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is termed Nature, and that is the ſchoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that doth teach the ſenſitiue ſoule of the Horſe what to doe:

               <p>An other queſtion I would demaund, whether there are not as good Horſes of other colours, the which if it be admitted, then the colour from complexion fayleth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer if yet you reſt not ſatiſfied, I will ſet down the wordes of two learned writers, that after longe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10570:29"/>diſcourſe thereof, ſay that <hi>de pilo diuerſi diuerſa ſentiunt</hi> of the colours of haire diuers doe diuerſlie thinke. And <hi>Ouid</hi> &amp; <hi>Virgill</hi> two famous learned men, are direct oppoſite each to the other in opinion of colour of horſes: the one of them affirming the white colour beſt, and the other denying the ſame, beeing a colour according to the rule of complexion the moſte worſt: and yet I could giue excellent examples of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of white horſes, but the more this cauſe is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the more the error of colour is manifeſt: but as I haue ſaide for this matter <hi>experientia omnium rerum certiſsima moderatrix,</hi> experience is the beſt moderator of this controuerſie. Now if you will yeeld your ſelfe to heare the originall of theſe former errors, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the beſt writers hereof haue ben much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for <hi>Opianus</hi> ſaith, that colours of horſes were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and maintained for hunting of wilde beaſtes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) the colour of ſome horſes is hatefull to ſome beaſtes more then to others: and vppon ſuch like cauſes haue the learned writers alowed colours, leauing to poſterity their opinions what colours they thought beſt for ſuch actions: ſince which, ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſeeming (or at leaſt making ſhew to vnderſtand much, making greate Bookes of diuerſitie of matter, haue ſet downe colour a principall cauſe of a good horſe, ſo as by tranſlating and taking notes out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens labours vntruely, collecting and adding their owne conceits (not being able to vnderſtand the naturall cauſes) they haue made al men almoſt be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with toies, and not with true iudgement, &amp; thereof do notwithſtanding wonderfully tryumph, playing as he that hath gotten nothing, holdeth it faſt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10570:29"/>ſo as if the horſe be a brown-bay, with a white ſtarre, white foote, or ſuch like, he is valued oftentimes more then he is thrice worth. Thus hath many ages taken that for a cauſe, which is no cauſe: there is nothing more true, then that the goodneſſe of the cauſe is the goodneſſe of the effect, for as <hi>Bernard</hi> well noteth, <hi>ſi bona fuerit cauſa pugnantis, pugnae exitus malus eſſe non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> if the cauſe of a quarell be good, the effect and iſſue thereof cannot be euill: and as I haue ſaid, ſo I ſay ſtill, that all true knowledge ſeeketh after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cauſe of thinges to attaine to the knowledge and effect of the thing, and from the effects and euents to finde the knowledge of the cauſe: Thus you ſee that to depend vppon ſpeech without probable reaſon, and without ſhewing the cauſe of ſuch things as they publiſh to the world, doth infect with error all thoſe that entertaine the ſame, and will dayly increaſe ſo long as they <hi>ſectari riuulos &amp; non petere fontes,</hi> thinke the ſpring clearer then the fountaine,

And all thinges muſt be conſidered and allowed, that are in perfection, which is mediocritie, &amp; not in their imperfection, which is euermore in extreames, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be reiected: beſides, if the hoofe ſhould bee hollowe and drie, it cannot be perfect, for then by the hollownes it would be the more dryer.</p>
               <p>Againe, to haue it large and round is not perfect, for thereby it will be fleſhie and club-footed, which is propper to Iades: and as to the tendernes of his foote,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10570:32"/>that it ſhould be a ſigne of lightnes, as it hath no truth ſo it hath no reaſon to defend it, but a plaine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt demonſtration of fearefulneſſe, by reaſon of his tender hoofes: and how he ſhould vppon trauell ſtrain his fore-legges, and his backe and ſpare his hoofes, I cannot vnderſtand, but ſure I am that ſuch horſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long continue or endure hard trauel for mans vſe, the end of his creation conſiſting altogether in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nor otherwiſe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That his paſternes ſhould bee ſhort, neither to lowe nor too high, &amp; therby ſtrong beneath, and not apt to fownder: I anſwere that his paſternes ſhould bee anſwerable in length and ſhortneſſe to the naturall and equall proportion of the body, and the ſhortneſſe of the paſterne is no more aſſurance of ſtrength, then to ſay, that euerie thing that is ſhort is ſtrong, or that euerie ſhort boned beaſt is ſtrong, for the ſtrength of the paſterne is the vprightneſſe thereof, and not the ſhortneſſe: doe you not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p n="4">4. That his ioynts ought to be great, with long fetter-lockes behinde, and that the ſame is a ſigne of force, I anſwere the greatnes of his ioynts, are words doubtfull, becauſe they may be great of bone, without much fleſh, which of it ſelfe is good: and yet may a great leane ioynted Horſe be weak &amp; a Iade, but the greatneſſe of ioynt muſt be anſwerable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his body, otherwiſe the great ioynt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle auaileth: and as to his long fetter lockes, it may bee a token of a moiſte conſtitution, and not of ſtrength, for then the more haire the more ſtrength, but his ſtrength lyeth not in his haire as <hi>Sampſons</hi> did, neither is it any part of his ſhape.</p>

               <p>Firſt therefore I affirme, that euerie good Horſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is and ought to bee bolde, I meane not (as the prouerbe ſaith) ſo bold as blinde Bayard, whoſe ſenſes

<note place="margin">Difinition of feare.</note> for as feare is defined to be an awe of ſome euill drawing neere at hand, ſo hauing poſſeſſed the creature, it depriueth him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comforts, which nature originally had affoorded: for the Horſe which remaineth neereſt his originall creation, goeth foorth, as <hi>Iob</hi> in his 29.

               <p>Firſt therfore intending inſtitution of a good thing I thinke moſte fit to obſerue, <hi>Cicero</hi> his rule, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with true diffinition,
<note place="margin">Difinition of nature.</note> and leauing diuerſities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, I define Nature thus: nature is not the thing it ſelfe, but the proper and peculiar ſtrength of the thing naturally giuen vnto the Creature in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the time of the framing, &amp; not at the birth, where it receiueth that quallity which it hath not only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working, but alſo of begetting &amp;c. and as it is a ſtrength bred and grafted in the creature at his framing, it therefore commeth not by chance or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, neither is it mutable but naturall, peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and vnchangeable: but becauſe Nature may bee two waies vnderſtood, <hi>viz:</hi> a particuler &amp; a generall, I will firſt ſhew that diuerſitie. The particuler nature is that which in euerie ſingle ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce miniſtreth eſſence to the whole compound, &amp; with all is mother to ſuch action &amp; motion as is agreeable to the ſubiect, wherin it is as the nature of fire cauſeth fyers aſcention, the nature of earth, the earthes going downward. The

               <p>Firſt of the Fyer,

               <p n="7">7. Seauenthly, to breake the colde of the water and earth, ſo as it may not diſtemper the bodie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond element is the Ayre,
<note place="margin">Aeyr</note> and placed next the fire, and is light and hot, but chiefly moiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt by reaſon of his moiſture, I meane not a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh moiſture, but a comforting nouriſhing moiſture, as oyle is to the lampe,

               <p>The third element is Water, which though heauy and moiſt,
<note place="margin">Water</note> yet moſt colde.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, by meanes of his coldenes (for colde is not actiue) it doth conglutinate and ioyne his bones with fleſh and ſinewes,

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it doth gather that together, which the fire would diſperſe aſunder: for the nature of heate is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and diſperſe that which colde hath conioyned, and of colde to binde that which heat hath diſſolued.</p>

Laſtly, if an olde Mare and a young horſe ſhould beget and bring forth, then would the Colt be framed of a ſeed of the horſe, little hot, but ouer moiſt and of a ſeede of the mare cold and ouer dry, wherein cannot be any perfection of equal temperature, ſo as it appeareth an approoued conſequent in Reaſon, that the middle age of the horſe, hauing a ſeede hot &amp; drie and the mare a ſeede cold and moiſt, with great plenty of fulneſſe on both parts, in the greateſt perfection of heate and natural ſtrength of body, doe make equality of temperature, &amp; compound themſelues in ſuch high degree of perfection that they bring forth a Colt full of vitall ſpirit, great courage, boldnes, and pride, thin and dry bones, great ſinewes and Arteries of great ſtrength, louing, of long continuance, &amp; of ſuch beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and perfect ſhape thorough the naturall qualitie of heate, purifying the whole body from all manner of droſſe, &amp; in ſuch reſined manner, as though nature had aſſembled all her forces for the preſeruation of her ſelfe, and expulſion of her enemies, for ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good or bad ſeede, when it receiueth any well or il rooted quality euermore to communicate to the diſcendents accordingly.</p>

For if wee conſider the Colt and ſound the cauſes of his eſſence and nature, and conſider the cauſes which maketh him mooue, you ſhall finde that it is his heate and moiſture which are two principall qualities, conſiſting in all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, nouriſhers of nature, for ſo ſoone as heate and moiſture faile in any liuing creature, it can no more liue nor mooue, &amp; ſtreight is the body occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with contrarie qualities, coldnes and drynes, the enemies of nature. If you will mount &amp; aſcend higher to know what is the cauſe of thoſe two qualities heate and moiſture, you ſhal finde that it is becauſe al liuing creatures are compoſed of the foure elements, of fyer, aier, water &amp; earth, in which the ſaid foure qualities of heate, moiſture, coldneſſe, and drineſſe doe conſiſt, and while heate and moiſture rain in the body it liueth, but when cold and dryneſſe are predominate then dyeth it. Againe, if you conſider the cauſe of the heate and moiſture, and the other qualities which wee ſee in the foure Elements, and in the bodies made of them, yee ſhall finde the ſun the cauſe of the heat, &amp; the moone the cauſe of the moiſture: let vs paſſe farther, and ſeek the cauſe wherefore the Sunne is hot, and the moone moiſte, and from whence theſe qualities come vnto them, and we ſhall finde the ſoueraigne cauſe in God.

What were elſe the cauſe that two coltes bred by one Horſe and Mare, ſhould one exceed the other in excellency of action, which cannot be from inſtinct of nature, but onely from the temperature of the foure firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and that is the onely cauſe that one bruite beaſt performeth the workes of his kinde better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: being the onely ſchoolemaiſter to direct the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue ſoule what to doe, but the vegetatiue ſoule on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth, how to forme the colte, to giue him the ſhape which he is to keep, to receiue nouriſhment, to retaine it, to diſgeſt it, to expell the excrements, and if any part of the bodie doe faile, ſhe knoweth how to ſupply the ſame anew, and to yeeld it compoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the vſe which it is to holde. But the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue ſoule onely worketh ſo far in the colt, that when it is foaled, it knoweth to ſucke, to draw forth the milk with his lips, to the preſeruation of his nature, and preſently to eat onely thoſe thinges, whereon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes accuſtomably do feede, and heereby you ſee what thinges in nature are proper, to the temperature, and to the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue ſoule.</p>
               <p>And although ſome wil ſay that God hath original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen to thoſe creatures, this naturall inſtincte, yet it may not be denyed, but the Naturall inſtincte muſt be the ſelfe-ſame, with the temperature which

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:10570:72"/>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if the braine be pure, the ſencible ſoule of the colte goeth alwaies vnited with the diſpoſition thereof, which directeth the bodie to euery action, and nothing offendeth the ſenſitiue ſoule, ſo much as to make his abode in a heauie bodie, ſurcharged with great bones, and heauy fleſh, and that is the reaſon which <hi>Plato</hi> yeeldeth, that the beſt and fineſt mettle Horſes are of thin bone, but if the Horſe be not of a iuſt and true proportion of temperature, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there is not any ſuch perfection in that Horſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the ſeede is meere vegetatiue and not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſence, but only followeth the motions of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature, therfore if the ſeed be perfect it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch force, that after the meate is diſgeſted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it maketh them though bad and groſſe to turne to his owne temperature, and ſubſtance, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vtterly depriue the ſame of the inherent qualitie, for the humors do attaine the qualitie which the meat had before it was eaten.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly there muſt be great diſcretion vſed in feeding of the Mare, vntill ſhee haue foaled, leaſte by long vſe of ouerbad meates,
<note place="margin">The meanes to preſerue the colte in the wombe.</note> the Colte in the wombe bee impayred of that qualitie of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it had from the ſeede, for otherwiſe it little auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to haue begotten a Colte of perfect ſeede, if you make no reckoning of the meat, which afterward the Mare feedeth vppon, and therefore the Mare may not ſo far eat of contrarie meats, as the Colt ſhall loſe thoſe good qualities, which it receiueth of the ſeede whereof it was made.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon heerof is cleere (but neuer obſerued by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10570:73"/>any) for at the beginning, the ſame being made of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate ſeede, and that the colte groweth euery day, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring and conſuming, and is to be repaired by the aliment &amp; foode it taketh, it is certaine, that if they be bad, and of euill temperature, that the continuall vſe of them, being in the wombe, will make great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in nature, and therfore to continue the colt in the excellency of his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature, it behoueth that the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it taketh, be endowed with the ſame qualities, as the colde doe not exceed the heat, nor the moiſte the dry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fiftly it appeareth that colts begotten, when the Horſe and Mare go to graſſe (whereof all our practiſe is witneſſe) cannot be begotten but of colde and moiſt ſeede, how excellent ſoeuer the horſe and Mare were, neither can the ſame colts after they are foaled, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſſibilitie be reſtored to perfection of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the beſt keeping in the worlde, becauſe they take the qualities of their temperature, at the time of their framing, <hi>Nam alteratio propria eſt mutatio et pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus a qualitate ſenſibili in aliam ſenſibilem qualitatem contrariorum, vt albo in nigrum:</hi> for a proper and true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration is a change and going forward from one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible qualitie into another ſenſible qualitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and therefore can neuer be vtterly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and taken from them againe, no more then that which is naturally white, turne naturally into blacke.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixtly the meate that Horſes and Mares doe eat, ought ſpecially to be regarded, leaſt their braines bee thereby diſtempered, becauſe the braine and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack are vnited and chained together, with certaine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10570:73"/>ſinewes, whereby they enterchangeably communicate their damages, and we ſee that ſome Horſes are Iadiſh in qualitie, and ſome good in qualitie, which groweth from hauing their braine well or euill inſtrumentali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And if any do affirme that horſes haue no braines, I would haue them anſwere, from whence he hath his ſence, and what is the cauſe of ſtaggers in a Horſe, if it be not the oppreſſion of the braine: and the liuer, the heart, and the braine, being firſt created and truly ſaid the vitall ſpirits and arteriall blood, from whence the ſenſitiue and motiue ſinewes haue their being, which go wandring thorough the whole bodie, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to ſtirre vp the powers of the horſe, to giue him force and vigor to worke.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſaide that the good qualitie of the meat that the Horſe and Mare eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the action, is the cauſe of the good or bad temperature of the ſeede, &amp; that the good or bad temperature of the ſeed, maketh the goodneſſe or badneſſe of the Colte, which beeing admitted, then it is demaunded, wherefore Horſes, and Mares, that are Iades, beeing ſo dyeted and kept, ſhould not haue a perfect temperate ſeede aſwell as the beſt Horſes,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt it is obiected againſt mee, that I doe admitte the Mare to take the horſe at any time of the yeare, when al writers of this ſubiect admit only the monethes of March, Aprill and May, becauſe thoſe three monethes are ordayned thereunto (ſay they) by Originall Nature, wherof God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Author, and the naturall reaſon and cauſe therof, as they affirme is, for that the humor of blood being the principall humor whereof the colt is compounded, &amp; in it ſelfe hot and moiſt, doth in thoſe three monethes rule and raigne, and therefore in reſpect of his heate fitteſt for generation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond cauſe wherfore thoſe three months are fitteſt for generation is, for that in the monethes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10570:79"/>of Iune, Iuly &amp; Auguſt, the humor of the Choler doth Raigne, the which is hot and dry, and therefore vnfit for generation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third cauſe is, for that in the monthes of September, October and Nouember, the humor of Melanchollie doth raigne, which is colde and dry, and that is alſo vnfit for generation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth cauſe is, that in the moneths of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Ianuarie and Februarie the humor of Fleame doth raigne, which is cold and moiſt, &amp; that alſo moſt vnfit for generation, and ſo they conclude, that God being the God of nature, and of order, and manifeſted as a meanes for the increaſe and preſeruation of his creatures, hath from the beginning ordayned the ſame: and for the aſſured confirmation thereof vnto man, hath more plainly manifeſted the ſame, 1. firſt by the example of all liuing creatures, who by the onely inſtinct of nature, doe in thoſe monethes in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kindes, beget and increaſe.</p>

                  <head>Anſwere.</head>
                  <p>Touching the limitation of time, namely March, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, and May, to be the onely monethes and times for generation, in reſpect that the blood hath then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the humors, I deny that propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my reaſon is, that the equalitie of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the humors in a ſound and perfect creature, are alwaies in true proportion and harmony, and that the predominate qualitie of any of them, is the cauſe and onely true witneſſe of ſickneſſe or intemperance, the which may not bee admitted either in horſe or Mare, that doe beget and bring foorth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly becauſe it is propounded generally, I anſwere that the humor of blood in thoſe three monthes is more often vnperfect, and predominate in euil qualitie then in any other of the months, &amp; that al the humors in thoſe three monethes are more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate then in any other, and the practiſe of Phiſicke generally more vſed in thoſe three monethes, then in all other monethes of the yeare beſides, ſo as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the propoſition ſo generally propounded, offereth great queſtion for the incertaintie, but I doe admitte that the perfection of blood in all creatures, is moſte principally of all the humors to be reſpected, and before all times and ſeaſons of the yeare to bee preferred, and not to be limited and compaſſed within any certaine time, and therefore I doe not referre ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to any particular time, but to the perfection of the particuler creatures, that haue a firme ſtanding habit of body, which is truely tearmed a perfection of temperature of the foure elements.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:10570:80"/>
                  <p>For if blood do exceed in heat, it doth thereby ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely conſume and dry vp the radicall moiſture, and by the extinguiſhing thereof, deſtroyeth himſelfe: as we ſee in the burning of a lampe or candle, the which when the heat or flame is to great, it doth ſuddainely conſume the oyle or tallowe, and preſently extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth his owne light.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if the oyle or tallowe be corrupted, by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or matter of contrary qualitie, as water or ſuch like, it preſently deſtroyeth it ſelfe, and as of heat and moiſture ſo of the other humors: therefore reaſon which is mans onely guide, telleth all men that there muſt be a iuſt and true proportion of temperate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the humors, to compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſeed, &amp; make it fit for generation &amp; preſeruation of the creature, that is to bee begotten: for the predominate qualitie, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of qualitie, of any of them, cauſing a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall iarre amongſt them, is as a houſe or kingdome deuided in it ſelfe, which bringeth deſtruction to all: ſo on the contrary the ſimpathy of their agreement is the preſeruation of the whole, and this is onely to be reſpected and not the time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if I ſhould grant to M. <hi>Lopez</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that they doe not meane, any predominate qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the humor of blood, but a good &amp; iuſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, then doth not the blood rule and raigne ouer the other humors, &amp; then were the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it ſelfe, but admitting the beſt, which is that it ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as the head doth the bodie, in the beſt ſimpathie and coherens to maintaine the other humors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the bodie cannot haue his being, yet to ſay that thoſe three monthes are onely good for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10570:80"/>vnleſſe it can bee proued that in thoſe three monthes is the onely time of deſire for generation, which cannot bee generally graunted, becauſe daylye experience witneſſeth that they of themſelues, of their owne naturall deſire beget &amp; bring foorth in all other monethes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if the other three humors of Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, melancholly, &amp; fleam, ſhold rule in the other nine moneths of the yeare, how ſuddenly ſhould the whole kinde of all creatures decay, by reaſon of the great Iarr of the Elements, and thereby become mortall home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred enemies to Nature it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, if euerie humor hath quarterly in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeare his ſeueral rule and gouernment, (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prooued) and all learning affirmeth, that euerie horſe worketh &amp; expreſſeth the qualitie of his worke, according to the goodnes and badnes of his tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humors, then euerie horſe in euerie quarter of the yeare altereth the qualitie of his worke, &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent the qualitie of his nature, which reaſon and practiſe depoſe againſt, and how ſhould any man bee aſſured of the naturall qualitie of his horſe, which is perpetuall and not variable and vnconſtant, <hi>Nam omnia naturalia ſunt immutabilia.</hi> For all Naturall thinges are vnchangeable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, if nature ſhold allow, or of himſelfe ordaine any thing to his owne deſtruction, or to maintaine an enemie to himſelfe, were abſurde to admitte, when as Nature hath originally, or rather God the Author of Nature, bred a Sympathie in Nature, to deſire his owne preſeruation, and an Antypathy in Nature, to haue an innated hatred to all thinges that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10570:81"/>vnto it, as appeareth by the yong Lambe that runneth from the Wolfe, &amp; the Dog, the little Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the Kite, and ſuch like. So likewiſe when ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or infirmitie breedeth within the body, Nature laboureth to her vttermoſt power to expell her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sixtly, blood which is the heat of the body, muſt in all monethes of the yeare, haue a kinde of dominion in the Horſe, ouer the moiſture, aſwel as in thoſe three moneths, for in nutrition the thing nouriſhed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the inſtrument ordeined for that purpoſe, muſt actually worke vppon that, whereby it is nouriſhed, for the heate is maintained by the moiſture, otherwiſe it would preſently conſume it ſelfe: and it may not be denied, but euery agent muſt be proportioned vnto the patient, in the equalitie of exceſſe, therefore the heat being the ſole actiue of nutrition, muſt haue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the moiſture, the ſubiect matter of that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, how then can M. <hi>Lopez</hi> limit the dominion of blood onely to three moneths.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seauenthly it is a generall approoued truth, that eury Horſe &amp; other creature is framd in the womb, of the foure humors, and that he that hath the one hath the other, but not of equall proportion, for euery Horſe (moſt vſually) hath more of the one humor then of the other, for it doth not keepe vniformitie, but very few ſithence their firſt &amp; primary creation, from God, by whome they were created in true proportion of temperate mixture, but ſithence the defiled condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature, they haue bene and ſo wil remain iarring and out of order, from the hower of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, vnto their death, but euery ſlight change of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10570:81"/>foure qualities proportion, changeth not his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, who for the ſhort indurance of the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the bodie returneth to his former conſtitution, but the variation of their originall conſtitution, is the true proper cauſe of the diuerſitie and difference of the worke, which proceedeth from that inward ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cauſe of deſtruction, the diſagreement of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thereupon I conclude that the goodnes or badnes for begetting of Horſes, cannot truly be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to any ſeaſon, month, or time of the yeare.</p>

               <p>It cannot be denyed but that the Horſe and euerie other creature is compounded of the foure Elements, viz. Fire, Aire, Water and Earth, and that the iuſt and true proportion of the temperature of thoſe Elements, was in all thoſe creatures which were firſt, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally created by God in all perfection, without any manner of predominate qualitie, or iarring, and that the harmony thereof was the true cauſe of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but at the inſtant of time when man tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſed thoſe elements in all creatures did iarre and rebel each againſt the other, for predominate qualitie, &amp; ſo will continue vnto the end, and conſummation of all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, the which as I haue ſaid are now become hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred enemies to all creatures, and the onelye cauſe of ſickneſſe, and death of all creatures, yet the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie of nature in all creatures is ſuch, as it laboureth and ſo continueth to bee reſtored, to the firſt and true temperature, and to ſuppreſſe the iarring, not onelye for their preſeruation, but alſo for reſtitution to their primarie creation, from whence there cannot bee any truth more apparant, then the nearer the Colt doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10570:83"/>the true and iuſt proportion of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the elements in the creation, the nearer it attaineth to the primarie perfection, from whence alſo it followeth to knowe how to chuſe, and to gouerne the horſe and Mare, that ſhall beget and bring foorth, that their ſeede and ſubſtance of humors, wherof euerie Colt is compounded, may at the time of their action be of a true and iuſt propor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of temperature, and that the Colt begotten, may whiles it remaineth in the wombe, by the nutriment it taketh, be preſerved in the ſame temperature, and after the foaling ſo continually maintained, as the true ground of all knowledge in this ſubiect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitting any farther diſcourſe, I will proceed to ſet forth, how all men vpon the onely viewe of anye horſe, be he olde or yong may know, whether hee bee compounded of true temperature of the elements, viz. Euerie perfect ſhaped horſe hath a broad fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and great eye, to expreſſe his naturall boldneſſe and loue vnto man: leane head, thinne, ſlender, leane Iawes to expreſſe his refyned mettell, courage and quicke ſpirit: long high reared necke, to expreſſe the perfection of his reyne, and perfect ſight of the way to keepe him ſure footed: high reared withers, to ſet foorth the eaſie going by keeping the bodye of his Rider very vpright: broade, deepe cheſt and body, with vpright paſternes, and narrowe hoofe, to giue teſtimony of his great ſtrength and abilitie of body, to indure and continue long &amp; great trauel: And eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vntrue &amp; vnperfect ſhaped horſe, hauing in euerye part the contrary ſhape, viz. A narrow fore-head, litle eyes, fleſhy head, thick fleſhy Iawes, ſhort neck, ſet on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10570:83"/>like a Hog or Goate, a narrow ſhallow breſt &amp; body, weak bending paſterns &amp; fleſhye, broad &amp; club-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a moſte vile royle and a Iade in all and euerie his actions, ſo as all the Artiſtes and moſte excellent horſemen in the vniuerſall world can neuer endowe him with the leaſt perfection of action &amp; continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therin, wherby you may as truely &amp; infalliblie iudge the difference betwixt good &amp; bad, as the difference betwixt fire &amp; water, as alſo the perfection &amp; imper fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition &amp; temperature of his eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the time of his creation, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſee a horſe or colt that is naturaly lean &amp; dry, &amp; wil hardly be made fat, &amp; continne fat &amp; yet digeſteth ſpeedily, of a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubſtance of bodye, ſhort hayred, and the ſame hard and full of ſtirring, it is plaine that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the predominate humor of red choler, and that the blood wherof the ſeede was made, was of a darke and thicke ſpirit, and had much of the Gall, for if the blood had bene perfect, it would haue bene hot and moiſt, of an oilie ſubſtance, for want of which ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dical moiſture he doth too ſpeedily diſgeſt, neuer fat &amp; of ſlender ſubſtance, his hayre ſhort, dry and hard, for want of that moiſture to paſſe thorough the pores of the skin, to make the ſame ſoft, of length and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that hayre if it bee eaten will neuer bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by reaſon of his drynes, when as his bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten will be digeſted, beſides he cannot be long liued, wanting ſufficient radicall humors to feede his great heat, for the lack whereof hee is like to a lamp that hath a great flame &amp; little oyle, &amp; therfore ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conſuming the Oyle, it extinguiſheth his owne light, and this horſe is tearmed cholericke, and his ſhape muſt of neceſſitie bee defectiue in ſubſtance,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10570:84"/>becauſe largenes and great proportion of ſhape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth principally from moiſture, ſo as wanting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and fulnes of proportion, as I haue formerlye ſaide, he cannot be of continuance but quickly ſpent, like vnto ſmall dry wood which ſpeedily flameth, and therefore is ſpeedily conſumed, ſoone hot, ſoone colde, a great bragger but no performer, a fiery looke and countenance: in whome at the firſt entring into action there is no temperance, ſeeming rather to flye then to be content to ſtand quiet, and yet the trauell of a few myles through his violent heate and dryneſſe, ſpeedily ſpendeth his vital ſpirit, ſo that his hart which is the chariot of his life, and the fountaine of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits, and the hotteſt of all other his ſpirituall members, for want of ſufficient radical oyled moiſture to coole the ſame, is ſo ſmothered and choaked that of neceſſitie it yeeldeth. Againe, when you ſee a horſe that is long, large, looſe, and weake ioynted, hollowe eyed, not well compacted (although by hye and proud keeping he may make ſhew of ſpirit and vigor) yet not withſtanding aſſuer your ſelfe, that he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of the element of Water, which is altogether flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, which in predominate qualitie is heauie, moiſte and colde, and therefore a lubber and a Iade, beeing weake and looſe in all the parts of his body, by reaſon he wanteth the chiefe element of Fyer, which is hot &amp; dry, to exhauſt and drie vp his predominate quality of moiſture, to purge and refine the moiſture, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come full of vigor, ſpirit, and courage, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his actions.</p>
               <p>Alſo, when you ſee a horſe that hath a great fleſhy head, thick boned, and fleſhie iawes, a great fleſhy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10570:84"/>ioynt, a great thicke ſhort necke, and a full proportioned body, whereby hee ſeemeth a puiſſant ſtrong horſe, aſſure your ſelfe; the chiefe and predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Element in his compoſition was of the earth, which is melancholly, or black choler, which in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is colde and drie, and of the element of Water, which is heauy and moiſt, ſo as by the moiſture of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is fleame, it groweth great, ſo by the cold nes and drynes of the earth, which is melancholly, hee is framed a great heauie lumpe or maſſe, without true proportion of ſhape, and his actions in qualitie are heauie, ſad, and fearefull, and vnapt for action, other then as a great topp, which neuer goeth well but by ſtrong laſhing, neither can he bee of other qualitie, then according to the qualitie of the Elements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is compoſed, wanting the two moſt excellent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, which are, Fyer and Ayre, that is heate and oylie moiſture to raiſe his ſpirit to the liuely and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious performance of his actions, ſo as after hee hath come to bee ten yeares olde, hee will exceede in ſtumbling and falling flat downe, neither can bee of long life, wanting a iuſt and true proportion of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the foure elements, neither can the beſt keeping in the world, or the moſte skilfull horſeman of the world, bring him to performe any action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his nature, according whereunto euerie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worketh, the which nature is no other, then the temperature of the Elements, when hee was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and framed in the wombe, according whereunto his ſhape was framed, which beeing naturall, will bee perpetuall and vnchangeable in him vnto his death. And therefore there is not any truth can bee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10570:85"/>more apparant, then that a iuſt and true proportion of the temperature of the Elements maketh a Horſe of perfect ſhape and excellent qualitie: and hauing largely ſhewed you his vertues, I ſpeake not for them, if your ſight cannot commaund affection, let them looſe it, they ſhall pleaſe much better, after you haue troubled your eyes with the view of the iades deformities, and then how much more they pleaſe, ſo much more odious and like themſelues, ſhall the Iades deformities appeare, for this true light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries giue each to the other, that in the midſt of their enmitie, the one maketh the other ſeeme more good or euill.</p>
               <p>Now it reſteth to conſider how poſſible it can bee that a Colte can be compounded of a true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temperature, if you ſuffer Horſe and Mare goe to graſſe when they beget, and were all learning and reaſon baniſhed from this my aſſertion, the onely infinite number of iades, being a thouſand to one of good Horſes, would condemne the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall practiſe of all Nations, and their errors heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not to be defended.</p>
               <p>But if you obſerue the naturall quality of euery Element (if the inſtinct of originall nature be not annihilated, you will reforme your iudgement and conſequently your practiſe, in breeding) for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Element of fire (whereunto the humour of perfect blood is likened) dooth ſeuer the pure from the vnpure, ruſt and droſſe from the Iron, the copper and vnperfect mettel from the gold, the ſiluer from the impuritie of the Alleye or Ore, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The reaſon of the common practiſe of all nations, is for that a mare goeth with foale twelue moneths and ten daies, or there abouts: and therefore the moſte breeders would not haue the mare go to horſe, before thoſe moneths of March, Aprill, or May, becauſe her foaling time ſhould be neere the ſpring of graſſe, the which opinion and practiſe I thinke fit likewiſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10570:88"/>if the Mare be luſtie, and in perfection of health, when ſhe foaleth, at what time of the yeare ſoeuer it be, but that ſhe hath more milk for three weekes or a month, then the foale is able to ſucke, and to continue plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in milke, let her preſently after foaling bee milked ſo cleane as may bee, and ſo continued vntill the curd in her vdder be broken and diſſolued, which will make her plentifull in milk, a thing eaſily done, if ſhe before be made domeſticall, and the ſame is approoued true in all creatures that giue ſucke, ſo as if ſhe foale in the beginning of Winter, yet wil ſhe haue plenty of milk, being houſed, ſhe wil haue a more luſty, ſtrong, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and couragious Colt, of great ſtature, and greater ſtrength, and better able to indure hardnes, and keepe his fleſh better then if ſhe foaled at May day, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are, Although the graſſe maketh great quantitie of milk, yet the ſame is verie thin, and the winter food leſſe in quantitie, but verie thicke and of greater nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and that a Colt foaled in the winter will bee ſtronger then that is foaled in the Summer, becauſe that coldnes of ayre by vnyting &amp; knitting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (according to the nature of colde) giueth ſtrength much more then heate, for heat openeth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth and weakeneth, for all creatures are ſtronger in Winter then in Summer, and they will eate much more, and diſgeſt better in the colde then in the heat, becauſe the naturall heat is thereby in the inner parts, &amp; not diſperſed, and thoſe are moſt ſtrong &amp; of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtature that are bred verie far North, then thoſe in the ſouth. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his politiques ſaith, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch as are bred in colder countries, are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bigger bodyed, and better couraged, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10570:88"/>longer liued, for the coldenes of the compaſſing ayre reſtects the ayre into the inner partes, and by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection the heates force is increaſed, and the partes gathered better and cloſer together. And moreouer by giuing ſomtimes maſſhes, made with malte, or with wheat meale, and mixed with the pouder of brimſtone, of the rootes of <hi>Enula campana,</hi> of Polipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the Oake, Anniſeedes, Licoriſh, Fenegreeke Turmericke, Bay-berries, and ſuch like, which will not onely increaſe the milke of the mare, but alſo moſt medicinable for the healthfull preſeruation of her and her foale, and the Colte being thus wintered in the houſe with his dam, it will make it to feede of all manner of winter foode, and quietly take any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and become moſt gentle, being brought vp in the company of man from the day of the foaling, whereby it ſhall not neede to be tamed or broken, as other Coltes are, neither to be roughly handled for the curing of any hurt or ſorrance that may happen. Alſo (if you cannot otherwiſe iudge) you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by finde the natural qualitie and diſpoſition thereof, and being from his time of foaling, kept in a paued ſtable with ſtone (for ſo would all ſtables be) it will harden his hooues, not ſuffering them to become broad footed, making him moſt bolde to tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any ground, it will make him louing to the man, and bold to euery action, and to be taught many good qualities, and when the ſpring of graſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, it wil little or nothing regard the dams milke. And if any doe thinke that in the winter for lacke of milk it would be in penury or hindered of groweth, they do much erre therein, for it will feede fat, luſty,

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10570:89"/>the greateſt importance: againe whereas they affirme that the mare in may is moſt fit to receiue the Horſe, becauſe the time and ſeaſon is warm &amp; ſhe much col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the Horſe, they do little obſerue the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe of generation, namely the coldnes &amp; moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſeed, which the food of graſſe maketh, wherof no perfect ſhape can enſue, onely deſiring a Colte without any reſpect of goodnes &amp; perfection, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable witnes of all erronious practiſe in breeding. Againe, if the mare go to graſſe, and hath a colt long ſucking her, when foode and lodging is full of penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how can ſhe be full of luſt to bring forth a perfect ſtrong and luſty colte: &amp; althogh thewinter (in reſpect of winter) be open and ſeaſonable, and the mare full fed with graſſe, can any man doubt, but that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her natural deſire of generation wilbe quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; if it wer admitted that ſhe hath a deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, yet can the ſame be in ſuch perfection as ought to be for generation? Now commeth the true Chimiſt who turneth euery thing into ſiluer, that breedeth mony to the third generation, neither hath it ſooner any being then he ſets it to beget more, and he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out vppon charges, and yet would haue his Horſe cat good meat, but on his neighbours trencher, &amp; he ſaith that breeding colts in the ſtable is very charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but if he did once apprehend, that in that charge were gain, then were eury face of a colt a new Image whome he would adore with the higheſt veneration: if it ſhould be granted, that feeding at graſſe all the winter time, is ſomewhat cheaper then feeding in the ſtable, yet when the preſeruation of mare and colt in ſtrength and perfection of health, &amp; from the daunger of death, with fluds, ſnowes and ſuch like is

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10570:97"/>although they are more then halfe tamed thereby, yet many things remaine vndone, which muſt onely be directed by knowledge and practiſe. Now when the Colt is made gentle to ſuffer ſaddle and crupper to be ſet on his backe, ſhooes on his feet, and alſo led to water, and walked in the hand, in all gentlenes, then take another gentle Horſe, and ſaddle him and the Colte alſo, and ride vppon the olde Horſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Colte in a halter, let the ſaddle of the Colte be croſſe girded, becauſe the ſame is a ſure way to keepe the ſaddle in his due place, and the rider from caſting, for if you doe not croſſe gird the ſaddle, when the Horſe is emptie, the ſaddle and girthes wilbe looſe, and if any ſtriuing ſhould be with the Horſe when he is full (if the girthes be not croſſe) by ſtriuing to try his ſtrength, the thruſting out of the wind of his belly, will make either girth or ſtrapp to breake, whereby if he ſhould haue aduantage, he will euer after vpon like occaſion make like aduenture, which may turne to the ſpoyle of Horſe and man, and beſide the girding of a Horſe ouer the belly, when he is full, may breede paine or cholicke in his guts, and other ſuch like infirmities.</p>
               <p>Thus done ride foorth a mile or two, leading the Colte in your hand, and ſo come home againe, in all gentle and louing manner, but neuer goe out and come home one way certaine, neither vſually alight at one place, for feare of any euill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to ſettle in him through cuſtome, wherein if you finde him without reſiſtance to follow and to leade, ſometime alight from your Horſe, when you are abroad, and giue the colte a peece of bread, graſſe

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10570:101"/>the art reſteth, by the temperate and ſweet ſtay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it helpeth: and by clawing or gently patting the Horſe, it cheriſheth, and by ſtriking correcteth: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the hand by the ſtroke, ierke or ſound of a wand or rod, it often helpeth by vſing it mildely and gently, or clawing or ſcratching him therewith it cheriſheth, and by ſtriking hard correcteth. Againe, the hand with a bridle in ſlacking it cherriſheth, and by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it correcteth, and by the guiding thereof it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth the Horſe as a ſterne dooth the Ship, which in all motions and actions anſwereth to that motion which the hand mooueth. The leg when it gently prouoketh with the calfe, helpeth; when it hardly ſtriketh correcteth: the ſpurre alſo by gentle meanes helpeth, and by hard ſtroakes correcteth; ſo as to bring a Horſe to true obedience and perfection of action, he is to be helped, corrected, and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: he is to be helped to the end he ſhould not erre, and therein is great knowledge required: he is to be corrected, for his erres and faults committed; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is knowledge, fortitude, and temperance to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: he is to be cheriſhed for his well dooing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is both knowledge and reaſon required, whereby appeareth how euery good rider ought to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Of which, namely of the voyce, the hand and the leg, before I come to ſpeake of the action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the true vnderſtanding heereof is moſt proper, I purpoſe to giue a little further introduction: and firſt of the voice. When you minde to helpe your Horſe therewith, it muſt be with moſt milde &amp; cheareful voice, as to ſay, hey hey: hola, hola ſo boy ſo, hup, hup, enough, enough, no more: &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like: but a correction is all contrarie which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10570:102"/>is with a terrible or thundering voice, as villaine, Traytor, and many ſuch like, and in cheriſhing the moſte milde and ſweete voice is vſed, as my good boy, ſo my good boy, with an inclination of bending your body to him, and ſuch like, ſo as alſo the ſound of the voice is to be vſed, as wel as a voice pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by giuing a chirke with the tongue, which may be called clacking, in pronouncing wherof the tippe of the tongue ſtriketh the roofe of the mouth, as it doth in making the ſuppoſed ſound drawing neere the greeke word <hi>Clognus,</hi> and ſo alſo there is another ſound of the voice, as <hi>hah hah:</hi> The next, is the hand, which as I ſaide is the inſtrument of inſtruments, in the true vſe and gouernment whereof is the ground of the whole Art, and as for the bridle and the Rodd, they are but deade and ſenſeleſſe inſtruments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all vſe, when they are not appointed for that vſe, and the temperate and firme hand-bearing vppon a firme and ſweete ſtay, neither too much ſlacking nor to much drawing in euery good horſe, cauſeth a true and iuſt raine, a iuſt bearing, a iuſt ſtaideneſſe, with a light and ſweete mouth in all actions: ſo as, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the horſe doth, is both eaſie, ready &amp; perfect, and being done by delight, muſt of neceſſity be beſt done, becauſe it beſt pleaſeth both man and horſe, neither of them being moued to perturbation greef or pain, &amp; as for the rod &amp; wand being inſtrument onely for the hand, how or when it is to bee borne, offered, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or not vſed, I thinke fitteſt to referre the ſame to the proper place hereafter ſette foorth, and for the Bridle which the Italians properly call <hi>Il manico del timone,</hi> the handle of the ſterne, becauſe the Bridle go uerneth the Horſe, as the Sterne dooth the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10570:102"/>ſhip requiring reaſon and diſcourſe therein, I thinke alſo fit to referre to his proper place, where the horſes leſſons ſhall be taught.</p>
               <p>The third thing is the legges, wherein the vſe of the calfes of the legge, the heeles, the ſtirrop, and the ſpurre are to be handled, I referre alſo to his proper place, whereby I would auoide all teadiouſneſſe and diſorder both for the eaſier attaining of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the ſure-keeping thereof in memorie, for the blindneſſe of mans wit through the diſobedience of our firſt parents is ſuch, as not hauing a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to followe, preſently runneth into error, the which whoſoeuer doth not knowe, hee knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and is ignorant of himſelfe, diſpiſing al diuine and humane witneſſes, and the example of all ages; &amp; therefore I haue onely deuided the ſame into certain preſcript generall groundes or rules to followe, whereof the Ryder ſhall haue dayly vſe in the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole art to his horſe and ſchollers.</p>
               <p>Firſt when the Ryder beginneth to teach a young horſe, or a young Scholler, let him follow the order of a diſcreete Schoole-maiſter, that teacheth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to write, who at the firſt intreateth and entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Scholler into his ſchoole in all louing ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; gentle vſage, aſſuring him, that in his ſchoole is nothing but paſtime, pleaſure, and delight; and ſo winning and calling him vnto him, cauſeth the ſchol let to take pen, paper and inke, and in a moſte milde and gentle manner ſheweth him how to carrie his arme and hand, and holde his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10570:103"/>of the infancye of his knowledge and willing minde to perform, is not onely to be commended, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded of his maiſter, wherby the ſcholler is ſo farre encouraged and imboldened, as hee ſeemeth ouer ioyed and ſtill deſireth and laboureth to goe on to be taught, and to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by milde teaching, ſlow teaching, not weried with long teaching at one time, but giuing often breath, high keeping in courage, often rewarding, great familiaritie, no change of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der til he be perfect, no change of bitt, no rough bitt, no cutting or galling noſe or mouth, but gentle fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, no beating nor whipping, no violence nor paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

               <p>In the pacing of the Ring, you may not carry ouer hard hand, to dull the ſence; but ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as the feeling may be alwaies freſh, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the violent haling thereof, by much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Noſe, whereof hee would willinglye haue eaſe, to auoide the ſame, he wil ſet his head &amp; necke awrie: the true vſe therefore is, that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Furrowe iuſt and ſtreight with his bodye, you moooue him gentlye to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in the verie motion turne him on the right hand, by drawing verie ſoftlye the right Rayne ſhorter with your right hand, lowe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pomell of the Saddle, whereunto if hee yeelde (as no doubt but hee will,) eſpeciallye hauing trodde the ſame before, preſentlye make much of him, neither drawing nor ſlacking the Reyne: at which time of dooing, both for eaſe

               <p>Hauing ſpoken of pacing the Horſe in the Ring, it followeth, that after the ten daies expyred, the Horſe bee taught to trotte the Ring, which muſt be begun in as ſlow &amp; gentle trot as he was in his firſt beginning of pacing, increaſe his ring-turns by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10570:108"/>two &amp; two euery day, vntil he make ten turnes for the left ring, &amp; 12. for the right, which wil increaſe his ſwiftnes, whereof he would be reſtrained vntil he be moſt perfect (as I haue ſhewed in teaching the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to write) &amp; then wil he do it in the greateſt grace and pride that may be, which is the true propertie &amp; qualitie of all Art, euermore to effect perfection, during which time of beginning of trotting, he may not be ridden with wand, nor weare any bytt, vntill he be moſt perfect in trott, ſtoppe, and turne wel on both hands, and not by any meanes ſuffered to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, vntill hee can alſo perfectly aduance, by which meanes he will be iuſt in his pace, iuſt in his trot, iuſt in his ſtoppe, with a ſtaide head and necke, being the chiefe goodneſſe that nature and Art affordeth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when you begin to trot the Ring, be ſure that at the firſt he bee moued therunto, as gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quietly as you can deuiſe, and ſo to euerie act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion whatſoeuer, vpon a ſtayed, temperate, and firme hand, with a ſweete ſtay, &amp; with a true reyne, that is, that his noſe be iuſt vnder his fore-head, neither too much out, nor too much in, which is the iuſt placing and ſetling of the head, which will make him haue a pleaſant mouth, when hee commeth to weare the bitt, and in this conſiſteth the chiefe point of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhippe, becauſe hee is ſo to be maintained in all his actions, the which is moſt eaſie to bee done, and continued, if the horſe bee of perfect ſhape and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but if he ſhold make reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for that he is either rammage or euill broken, then trot him ſwift with quickneſſe of voice, rod, and ſpurre, for the time of his trotting is the fitteſt time to make him forgette
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10570:108"/>his toyes, and to attend his way, and if all this wil not helpe, then ſpare not to gallop him, and then be ſure he will be a I ade from the beginning to the ende, for a Horſe of good temper and perfect ſhape, can neuer be of ſo bad nature and qualitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I thinke fit now to ſhew, how to make your Horſe perfect in ſtop, after you haue ended the number of your Ring turnes, which is to trott your Horſe right out in the middle furrowe betwixt the Rings, vntil you come at the place of ſtop, and there to make a prettie ſtay, keeping his bodye right in the pathe, wherein, if the whole body, or any part ſtand ouerthwart, ſeeke not at firſt to correct him for the ſame, but let a foote-man direct him to ſtand right in the pathe, by thruſting in that part which ſtandeth out of order, or you may cauſe the horſe to goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame path, and ſtoppe him, holding that raine ſtraiter on that ſide, whereon hee moſt forceth your hand, then on the other, which wil enforce him to keepe right, which when hee yeeldeth, euermore cheriſh him, and after it will be good to trot and ſtop him on a ground that is a little ſteepe, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing falleth, and immediately riſeth, but when he is perfect, then you may doe it on a ground verie ſteepe: but to teach him to goe backe, you muſt (as I haue ſaide) keepe a firme ſtayed hand on him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giuing libertie, and then ſtriking him on the necke with your rodde, and in that inſtant time ſay <hi>backe, backe,</hi> but if hee refuſe, let a foote-man with a rodde gently ſtrike him on the knees, &amp; ſo by gentle pulling in of your hand and fayre meanes win him, and when he yeeldeth, cheriſh him.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:10570:109"/>
               <p>Hauing ſhewed how to ride your Horſe without wand, bit, or ſpurre, I will now ſhew you how to ride with all three, and the true vſe of the hand vpon the bit, the chiefe &amp; only principall point of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Firſt therfore when you ride with a wand, take it very warilye, that the Horſe bee not feared therewith, &amp; to aſſurethe horſe therof, preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue receiued it, coy and ſcratch him about the necke with the end thereof, and for the carrying thereof it muſt be in the right hand, with the point vpright, and when you would vſe it, let the point fal cloſe vnto him as occaſion ſhall require: but in your manage lay your hand on your right thigh, and the wand croſſe the Horſes necke, and when he hath made his courſe and turned on the right hand, then before the end of his ſecond courſe, when he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to tourne on the left hand, liſt your hand and rod, &amp; hold the point right foorth on the right ſide, againſt his eye, and as he changeth turnes, ſo change your rod of the one ſide and of the other; but if your Horſe will not turne on the ſide you would haue him, euermore beat him on the contrary ſide: and when he is any way diſordered, carry the wand on the contrary ſide, and when you would haue him carry his forepart light, ſtrike him on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and forelegs, and when you would haue him light behinde, ſtrike him one the rump and hanches: and thus much for the vſe of the wand as occaſion ſhall ſerue.</p>
               <p>Now for the true vſe of the bit, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument onely guided and directed by the hand, &amp; becauſe the ground of the art of riding dependeth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10570:109"/>wholly vpon the vſe and true gouerment of the hand, being guided by reaſon and diſcourſe, ſo as the Horſe in all motions and actions is and ought to anſwere to that motion, which the hand mooueth, I may not paſſe the ſame ouer-light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore let the bit that you firſt bit your Horſe withall, be gentle and pleaſant, yet ſo that the gentlenes cauſe him not to diſpiſe you, nor the hardnes driue him to diſpaire; for you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that knowledge alwaies preſuppoſeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reaſon ſence; and ſence and reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in true mediocrity, and therefore amongſt the moſt learned precepts that were written in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Graecia,</hi> this was in the ſecond place nothing too much.</p>
               <p>SOLON ſaide nothing more then enough, PIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TACHVS doe all thinges by a mediocritie, ſo that all difference betwixt good and badde conſiſteth in a certaine mediocritie, which CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERO calleth the beſt of all thinges; for when you preſſe him with the bridle, if hee carryeth his head well, yet muſt you preſentlye eaſe your bridle hand, and make much of him, becauſe hee ſheweth himſelfe obedient vnto you, and whenſoeuer hee doth anye thing well, and with delight, you muſt bee verye heedefulnot to vexe him, as if your deſire were to torment him, but euer ſo winne him, as hee may bee willing to pleaſe you.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe when you beare a firme hand with a ſtay; &amp; thereby the Horſe doth bring in his head,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10570:110"/>and yeelde to your hand, yet you muſt ſhorten the raines of your bridle, till his head bee ſetled in due place, that is neither to carie his fore-head too much out, nor too much in, &amp; ſtil maintaine him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme in all his dooings, yet that it exceede not mediocrity or temperature, but remaine light on the hand with a ſweet mouth. Thus hauing ſhewd you, that it muſt be done, I will ſhewe you how to doe it, by keeping this order: ſtay your horſe temperately with the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle vpon a ſtayed hand, as his reſiſtance ſhal require, without giuing any libertie, then with your rodde ſtrike him gently vpon the bowing of the necke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking him with the ſpur on that ſide, hee moſt wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his buttock, to the end he may goe iuſt, vntill he draw backe one of his forefeete, which if hee doe, make much of him, and then ſtay a while, and do the like, drawing onely the bridle, for the former cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing will cauſe him to vnderſtand you, and then wil he goe lightly backe with both the fore legges, when you touch him on the necke with the rodde, ſaying with a lowde voice, <hi>backe:</hi> at which voice with the feele of the rodde, and drawing of the bridle, he will goe backe to your deſire, and alwaies after, when hee is out of the due and true ſtay vppon the bridle, doe the like, that is to goe backe in forme afore-ſaid, and although ſome diſorder be committed, haue no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, for you ſhall finde him eaſily wonne to a good mouth, by this vſe of a temperate and firme hand, which is by the mediocritie of ſlacking and drawing, which is propperly tearmed a ſweet ſtay,
<note place="margin">What is a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and firme hand.</note> which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Dolce Appoggio,</hi> making him light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand, champing the bitt with great pleaſure, and a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10570:110"/>ſtayed head in due place, the true tokens whereof are iuſt rayne, iuſt ſtaide, and light borne head with pleaſure on the bit, being properties inſeperable in euery perfect ſhaped Horſes actions, but becauſe it may ſeeme very difficult to haue continuance of perfection in euery action, although it is common vppon ſtop, or ſtanding ſtill, to be in order, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps vpon motion, he wil leaue playing on the bit, and beare vpon the hand, eſpecially vppon the maine careere, which commeth for want of true knowledge how to maintaine and continue the hand iuſt and firme with a ſweete ſtay, ſo as he may take pleaſure on the bit, and therefore how to maintaine a Horſe both in furious and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et dooings, is to be conſidered of, if then at any time he make any diſorder, note it dilligently, and by and by ſtay fayre and gently, and make him go backe as you did before, for in going backe he wil bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his right order again, then preſently make much of him, and forthwith mooue him forward, faire and gently, till he come to the place of ſtop, and as he muſt be thus vſed in going forward, ſo muſt he be vſed in treading of the rings, firſt gently vppon the pace, vppon the trot, and ſo vpon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, in practiſing wherof you muſt preciſely obſerue that it be done with a temperate, ſtayde, and firme hand, otherwiſe he will gape, thruſt his tongue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the bit, or ouer the bit to defend himſelfe, thruſt his head out ſudd ainely, pluck it in diſdainefully, or elſe ſhaking or moouing his head one way or other, to be freed from the preſſing of the intemperate hand which is to him violence and contrarie to Nature,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10570:111"/>the which Art ſhold euermore labour to pleaſe. The true forme &amp; practiſe of drawing the bridle, is alſo to bee learned, which is, that being mounted in the Saddle, let the Ryder draw the Raines equall, and if the Horſe know not the Bytt, then let the Bytte bee verie ſlack, and hold the Raines in his left hand, with the little finger and ring finger betweene, vnder the pomell of the ſaddle, as neere the withers as he can, and then with the right hand draw the raines ſoftlye and equally together through the left hand, ſo as the ſtanders by can ſcarce perceiue, the which hee may not remooue, vntill he feele the Horſe begin to ſtay vpon the bytt, &amp; then there hold them without ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or farther drawing, vntill hee peruſe whether the head ſtandeth in true forme, which if it bee not, then let him a little yeelde his left hand againe, and ſtanding ſo a prettie while, bring his left hand to his former place againe, where the Horſe made the firſt ſtay vppon the bytte, but if you perceiue the Horſe doubteth whether to put it out, or bring it in, which will bee hardly perceiued, other then that then, hee ſtandeth without motion vppon the bytte, then drawe the Raines with your right hand, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more through the left hand as before, but ſo little and gently as can ſcarce bee perceiued by the Beholders, for ſo muſt all the motions of the hand bee, and then keepe it firme and ſtayed a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie while, and then if hee yeelde, though verie lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, keepe your hand ſtill at one ſtay, neither ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor drawing it, wherebye hee will feele the eaſe hee hath gotten by yeelding, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlye make much of him, but if it happen the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10570:111"/>Raines fall ſlacke, remooue not your left hand, but drawe the Raines through your left hand, as before, for they may not be ſlack vntill he ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vppon your right hand, whereunto when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he yeeldeth, make much of him, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in this ſort to ſolicite him, till his head be in his due place, that is neither too much out, nor too much in, after which time, if hee beare not light, let his keeper ſtrike him gently on the knees of his fore-legges to make him go backe, whereby he will bring in his head, and then will the bit mooue, and your hand finde eaſe, but be very carefull at that inſtant, to keepe your hand ſo firme, as you neither ſlacke nor drawe in, to the end he may feele and reteyne the eaſe of his owne motion of yeelding, which willingly he will not looſe, beeing delightfull to nature, but take delight to ſtir the bit in his mouth and goe backe withall likewiſe, the which when you finde, are tokens of the winning of his mouth, which beeing won, with obſeruation of good order, may be brought to continuall perfection.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed you ſo much as Arte may helpe, but if the ſhape and nature of the Horſe be oppoſite and repugnant, as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of Horſes it is, howſoeuer for a time it may ſeeme perfect, yet no doubt it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of continuance, and therefore ſtill deſire all men, to put their vttermoſt helpe for to increaſe a perfect breede of Horſes, and increaſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate teachers.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:10570:112"/>
               <p>But becauſe in the whole Art of Ryding there is no one thing more difficult, then to make a Horſe Trott iuſt, and that the pefection thereof is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all other his iuſt dooings, I purpoſe a little farther diſcourſe heerein, fearing that I haue beene too briefe, ſo as diuers doubts may ſtil ariſe amongſt ſuch as haue not had long knowledge and practiſe therein.</p>
               <p>Wherefore obſerue that when you are teaching your horſe heerein, or in any other leſſon, that you doe not trouble him, with anye other leſſon at that time, neither ſuffer him to begin to learne any other, vntill he be verie perfect in that he is in learning.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly that you doe not ſuffer anye other to ride him vntill he be perfect in ſuch leſſons you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to teach him, leaſt he be confuſed by diuerſitie of hands, and man-ner of teaching.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, when hee is brought to a iuſt ſtay of head, and aſſurance of the bytt, then doe you maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him therein to a full perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, when he is out of order, then ſtay him and make him goe backe, as before is mencioned.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fiftly, when he is in order, then make much of him, and ſtay not long, but with a firme hand faire &amp; gently put him into his pace againe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixtlye, if hee continue in his good order, make much of him, giuing your body, with a gentle moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the calfes of your legges, mooue him to doe it more ſpeedily, the which if he be by nature good, he will quickly performe, alwaies remembring to keep a firme hand, vnleſſe by bringing in his head, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10570:112"/>Reines fall ſlack, which muſt be then drawne as hath bene tolde you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seauenthly, if his trot continue not light vppon your hand, ſtay him, cauſe him to goe backe, which will bring him in order againe, and then gently put him into his pace, &amp; ſo to his trot as before; which being wel done, cheriſh &amp; coy him by all the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt &amp; beſt meanes you may, ſo that you may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win his loue therby, &amp; ſo for that time leaue him, &amp; lead him home by ſome leading line, in which time giue him a little graſſe or hay on your hand, and ſcratch him, &amp; ſpeake to him with the moſt louing words you may, which will make him at your next exerciſe, doe all thinges to your greateſt content, &amp; within twentie daies he will pace and trotte in ſuch order, as alwaies after you may trot him moſt ſwiftly in the rings or in manage.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Eightly, in his ſwift trot, by all meanes keepe your true feate and firme hand, ſo as he loſe not that excellent forme and grace before preſcribed, but do not galloppe him vntil he be iuſt and perfect in his ſwift trot, &amp; then out of that trot, to put him to a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et gallop in the large ringes, euen to the ſtoppe: but beware you draw not your hand haſtily to you, but by a little ſway of your bodye, backe and hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſtay your hand there til he come back a ſtep or two, &amp; there ſtay him &amp; ſuffer him not to go forward, &amp; in that inſtant make verie much of him, &amp; ſo let your hand and body go to the place againe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Ninthly, if he ſhould then offer to goe forward, ſtay him with the like ſway, and then alight &amp; lead him home, making much of him, as before.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Tenthly, to aſſure your ſelfe of the right vſe of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10570:113"/>this hath bene ſaide, and of the perfections therof, pace your Horſe ouerthwart ſome deepe fallowe, as faſt as you can for halfe an hower but ſuffer him not by any meanes to trot, keeping your hand in a firme and temperat ſtay, as before: and if you ſtill finde his head in due place, his cariage light &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant vpon the bit, you are aſſured you haue gained the perfection of the hand, and the true vſe thereof for the teaching and making of a yong Horſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obſerue that if he be of perfect ſhape, his head wilbe in due place, &amp; light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bit, without art.</p>
               <p>Now a little I purpoſe to ſpeake of the Horſe that is alreadie taught, and brought to perfection, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a good rider hath ſmall neede to vſe any rod, or other help, but to keep his true, iuſt, and perfect ſeat, becauſe the Horſe by the leaſt token or motion of bridle or ſpur, will do all thinges in ſuch time and meaſure, as the beholders will iudge the Horſe and rider but one bodie, one minde, and one will; and therefore how the reines ſhould be caried, placed &amp; vſed, is the onely thing to be ſpoken of. The reynes you muſt holde in your left hand, placing the little finger and ring-finger betwixt the two reines, and the thumbe cloſe vp on the reines, ſo as the hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue not from the creſt of the Horſe, for by the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the hand it is ſignified to the Horſe which way you would haue him turne: which is by ſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reyne on that hand you would haue him turne, and ſlacking it on the other: the order and manner there of hath bene and is yet diuerſly vſed of the beſt horſemen, and therefore I leaue it to euery mans vſe as he findeth it moſt fit: but in running at the Tilt, where the Horſe neither doth or can turne,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10570:113"/>the rider muſt not draw the bridle towards the Tilt, but only ſtrainethe reine that is next the Tilt to make him cary his head towards the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But becauſe the true ſhape and goodnes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Horſe is, it that art attendeth &amp; worketh vpon, in thoſe Horſes the rules of arte haue perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with continuance, ſo as the Horſe that is of perfect ſhape and well taught, ſhall not indanger winde or limbe, or deformity of body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next, your perſon ſhal neuerbe in perill by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or running away.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly the rider ſhall neuer be grieued with heauy bearing vpon his hand, but performe all with great delight: neither ſhal you need Cauetſane, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role, martingale, or ſuch like, but only falſe reines.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly &amp; laſtly, this teaching will manifeſt the difference betwixt true knowers and ignorant ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which doings the Horſe doth repreſent &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe when he would appeare moſt beautifull, and thereby make both the rider and himſelfe appeare moſt noble, terrible and beautifull to beholde, with ſuch delight to the beholders, as they will ſeeme to be rauiſhed with delight; all which is attained by good diſcretion, taking of time with temperance, which of few is little regarded, rather ryding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, and with ſuch extremitie of ſpur and rod, that for want of breath they commit many difor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereby the poore Horſe is cruelly tormented being no other then to ride as mad men without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, and as paſſionate and furious men without reaſon.</p>
               <p>After your horſe hath pefectly learnd ſwiftly to trot
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10570:114"/>perfectly to ſtop, &amp; perfectly go back; thon ought he to be taught perfectly to aduaunce, which is by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp both his fore-feete iuſt and euen together, like vnto a goate, ſomewhat aboue the ground, and ſo let them fal euen &amp; iuſt, twice or thrice together: the true dooing wherof wil cauſe him to make a iuſt perfect mannage, and a ready and perfect turne: for the attaining whereof, trot him gently fortie or fifty foote in ſome plaint way, then giue him a iuſt ſtop, which he wil truly perform, becauſe he hath before perfectly learned the ſame, alwaies keepe a ſteady, pleaſant, &amp; perfect ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the bridle: then inſtantly with a milde voice, ſay, <hi>hup, hup,</hi> ſtriking him in that inſtant with your wand on the right ſhoulder, &amp; alſo with both the calfes of your legs together, but ſpur him not, if poſſiblye without it hee wil aduance, the which with a little labor, &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teching, no doubt hee wil atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to do, 2. or thrice together; the which if he do, then in that inſtant make much of him (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh it be very meanly done) &amp; pauſe a little time &amp; giue breath, then trothim again in like maner, the like diſtance of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; as before, ſo gently vſe him again, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which if he do better adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, make much of him but if he do not better euery time hee is taught, you muſt ſtil folicite him vntil he doe better, &amp; then preſently coy him, &amp; make much of him: all which muſt be with temperance, &amp; not with furie, and be ſure to giue him breath, and not to be raſh or haſty, neither forget to make much of him, when at your direction hee doth any thing well; ſo ſhall you cauſe him to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame moſt delightfully, &amp; alſo ſencibly aprehend when he doth wel whatſoeuer you deſire, &amp; after that he can in plain grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perfectly adui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10570:114"/>then teach it him gently vpon the hanging knole of a hill, to bring him perfectly to ſtop, and runne ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon his bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for the teaching of your horſe to yerk, becauſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10570:115"/>thereby commeth much more hurt then good, I leaue to entreat thereof. And whereas ſome apoint many helpes for Horſes that are harder, to turne on the one ſide, then on the other (although I confeſſe their general deſire is more apt to the left hand then to the right) yet to a Horſe of good nature and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhape, little Arte will ſpeedily helpe, and to teach thoſe Horſes that are otherwiſe ſhaped, is but to teach an Aſſe to run vnder a bridle, and may truly ſay with <hi>Horace, O infelix operam perdas,</hi> O vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate skill to looſe thy labor, and ſo ſoone ſhall a ryder bring a Iade to perfection, as an Aſſe to play on a harpe: for as a good Horſe by the ſound of a trumpet is ſtirred and mooued to battaile, ſo <hi>Suem abigat citius, quam animet ad pugnam,</hi> the Sowe is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſooner chaſed away, then incouraged to fight, becauſe nature hath not made her for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It now remaineth to ſhew when to make the halfe turne and the double turne, the chambetta, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, to paſſe a ſwift cariere, the coruet, &amp; ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The next leſſon he is to learne, after he is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in thoſe I haue ſet down, is to make a true &amp; iuſt halfe and double turne, which would be in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Firſt when you haue gently trotted, ſtopped &amp; aduanced your Horſe the length of a ſhort cariere, teach him gently and mildly to make the halfe turne (beginning alwaies on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) that is to turn him with the helpe of your left leg, that his head may ſtand that way which before his taile ſtood, which is called a halfe turne, becauſe he maketh but halfe a circle; but if in the turne he ſet his head that way it ſtood at firſt, that is a whole circle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10570:115"/>called a whole turne; but let him firſt doe the halfe turne perfect, and let that bee his firſt leſſon, &amp; learne it very perfect before you teach him the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble turne, which muſt be done by helping him with your voice, and Calfe of your left legge, and not at firſt by any meanes to haue him ſpurred, if he can be otherwiſe brought vnto it, becauſe to ſpur is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which may not bee done but in that inſtant when he hath committed an error, and not while he remaineth ignorant what to doe; by which meanes vndoubtedly being a ſencible creature, he wil euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more perceiue his errors and offences, wherby with little correction he wil eaſily amend any fault; &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer driue him to diſpaire, for hauing formerly attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a iuſt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſwift trot in the rings, (the verie true ground of all other leſſons) he will eaſily turne on the right hand, ſetting his head that way his taile ſtood; the which being perfectly attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then cloſe it vp with another halfe turne on the ſame hand by the preſcribed helpes, ſetting his head and all his body in the ſame pathe it vvas at the firſt: then giue breath, and make much of him, and then make him doe as much on the left hand, and ſo to change from hand to hand, leauing alvvaies on the right; remembring that the tvvo firſt halfe turnes be done more leaſurely, then the tvvo laſt halfe turnes, vvhich muſt be done more ſpeedily, and then make him doe as much on the left hand, &amp; ſo change from hand to hand, leauing alvvaies on the right. Thus by often making much of him vvhen he doth vvell, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leaſure, &amp; giuing breath, you ſhal vndoubtedly, if he be of good nature &amp; perfect ſhape, make him do
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10570:116"/>ſwiftly, loftilie, and iuſtly, &amp; with ſuch grace as ſhall bring to the vnlearned beholder wonder, and to the skilful, admirable delight.</p>
               <p>In the doing wherof, firſt obſerue whether hee bring on the contrarie legge orderlie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hee doe it after the firſt bound of aduancing, and after at the ſecond or third bound.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that you alwaies begin on the right hand and end on the right.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that after he is perfect in dooing of the whole turne, that you make him doe it ſwiftlye and roundly, without ſtop or ſtay of the halfe turne, and ſpeedily in the cloſing of euerie whole turne, and in ſo narrow a roome as may be.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, after he is perfect as aforeſaide, giue him on each hand three whole turnes, wherof let the firſt be verie faire and ſoftly, beginning at the right hand and ending at the right, in the dooing whereof you muſt alwaies helpe him with your tongue, your rod and your legge, whereby a continual vſe before you teach him any other leſſon (which would neuer bee done vnleſſe he be perfect in the leſſon hee is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) you ſhall in the end with diſcreete and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate teaching, bring him to an admirable perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, keeping time and meaſure, that the one bee not ſwifter then the other except the laſt, which euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more would be moſte perfect and ſpeedy.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed to the managing of a horſe, the true ſignification whereof is to bee rightlye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by ſuch as endeuour Horſemanſhip, for <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis terminis ig noratur &amp; ars,</hi> to bee ignorant of the termes, is to be ignorant of the Arte, I take it to be a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10570:116"/>compound of theſe lattin wordes, <hi>manus</hi> and <hi>ago,</hi> for as the ſterne of a ſhip dooth guide and gouerne the ſame by a ſweete and gentle motion, ſo the hand (being the inſtrument of inſtruments) doth guide &amp; gouerne the Horſe to enerie action, and therefore may fitly be ſaide <hi>manu agere,</hi> or as the Italians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call <hi>Maneggiare,</hi> which is as much as skilfully to handle. And therfore when the rider ſhal exerciſe the Horſe perfectly and gracefully in his place, trot ſtop, aduance, double or ſingle turn, cariere, gallop, leape, caperiole, coruet, aſſaut, or whatſoeuer, the hand being the principall actor or <hi>primus moter,</hi> may truely and aptlye bee called mannage, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truely be done without the generall knowledge and practiſe of the generall preceptes of the whole Arte. And as all the former exerciſes muſt bee taught and begunne to be exerciſed vpon a ſoft pace or trott, and not with a galloppe, euen ſo ought his managing to be.</p>
               <p>And although many worthy Horſemen haue and doe onely reſtraine managing to gallopping, and to bring too and froe in one ſelfe pathe, by halfe reſt, whole reſt, or without reſt, as when the rider mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with halfe reſt, cauſing the Horſe at the end of euerie managing path, after hee hath ſtopped to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance twice together, and at the ſecond bound to turne and reſt one bound: doth not the Rider ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exerciſe the trott, the ſtoppe, the aduance, and the turne which he formerly learned, and according to the ſame maner: or when he manageth with whole reſt; and turne him at the third bound, and reſt two boundes: Or manage him without reſt, by turning
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:10570:117"/>him immediately vpon the ſtop, without anye tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or reſt at al, which only is moſt common with vs in England, and yet the manage with the halfe reſt is moſte neceſſarie for attaining of perfection; doth not the Ryder keepe and maintaine the Horſe in one path, one place of ſtop, making him keep his ground, and therein carrie his head, necke, legs, and all his body iuſt, cloſing his turne roundlye, and in narrow roome, with true time and meaſure in euery action, as he hath bene formerly taught? how then can managing be properlye referred to one onelie action, when it is the perfect acting of euerie action and leſſon he hath learned? wherin when your horſe is moſte ready and perfect, you may increaſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dooing of his leſſons at your will, and make alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his turnes and exerciſes, to finde out the perfection of his obedience, and when the ſame are artificially and perfectlye performed, then may the rider be truely ſaide a perfect manager, in all which alterations beware of furious paſſion, or of longer exerciſe, then you finde ful breath and delight in the horſe; wherin if there be any omiſſion, be ſure there cannot be perfection of the thing deſired: for as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is a braunch of magnanimitie, fortitude and greatnes of courage, ſo impatience is a weakenes &amp; imbicilitie, of a baſe, vile, and contemptible nature, becauſe choller &amp; anger are enemies to al reaſon, &amp; therfore ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> he that is ſlow to anger is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a mightie man, and he that ruleth his owne minde is better then hee that winneth a Cittie.</p>
               <p>Now reſteth it to ſhewe what are the principall things that are to be obſerued in the true managing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10570:117"/>of a horſe. Firſt he is to be taught his manage with a ſoft trot &amp; not with a gallop: my reaſon is, becauſe therby he may at the firſt, ſencibly apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what he is to do, &amp; how to do; the which when he knoweth, if he be of good nature &amp; perfect ſhape, he will not only do it moſt willingly, but perform it moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, graceful, &amp; praiſe-worthy, which is by bowing of his houghes behinde, to turn round with the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betta, which is by holding vp the forefoot on that ſide he ſhold turn, whiles he bringeth ouer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie leg, and ſetteth it not down vntil he haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his turn, ſo as therby he ſhal carie both his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feete aboue the ground, to his great praiſe, and not trayling vpon the ground which is diſgracefull.</p>
               <p>When you teach your horſe (which is after hee can ſtop wel, aduance before, and turne readily on both hands) then with a ſoft trot come to the place of ſtop about 20. paces in length, and make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance twice together, &amp; at the ſecond bound turne him on the right hand (for on that hand you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beginne) helping him ſo, that by bowing his houghs behinde, hee mooue his fore-part orderlye, then immediately in gentle maner trot him back to the place you came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; then &amp; there after he hath made his ſtop, at the ſecond bound of his aduancing turn him on the left hand, obſeruing the like order vntil you haue gone 10. or 12. times, and at the laſt, cauſe him to aduance twice together, &amp; thus much for the halfe reſt, the which when hee can perfectly doe, you may teach him the whole reſt, which is to aduance thrice, &amp; at the third bound to turn, but be ſure he be perfect in one leſſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before you teach him another.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:10570:118"/>
               <p>Now becauſe the mannage without reſt is moſte propper for Iades, I omit to entreate therof, becauſe I wold not admit <hi>Aſinum ſub freno,</hi> an Aſſe to weare a bridle: in all your managing let your body ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany your horſe in the action with a good grace, And vvhen he hath verie perfectlye learned his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, on a ſoft trot, then may you manage him vvith a gallop, giuing him on each hand one ſingle turne: and a little before you turne him, holde your rodde on the contrarie ſide, vvhereby hee ſhall knovve on vvhat ſide to turne, and at the ſtop make him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, either vvith voice, rod or ſpurre, alvvaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring to giue breath, and euermore beginne vvith a gentle gallop, vntill he be verie perfect, and then time will bring him to a perfect and ſwift ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: but I wiſh you ſo to vſe &amp; exerciſe your horſe, as when hee is become a perfect Horſe, you may long be maiſter of a perfect Horſe, and not to ſpend or ſpoile him in a little time, in teaching of him needeleſſe toyes.</p>
               <p>There might be much more ſpoken of helpes and corrections in managing, but becauſe they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Iades, or elſe to horſes that are euill taught, I omit them: for if your horſe be ſuch as he ought, &amp; your ſelfe temperate and diſcreete (otherwiſe I wiſh you not to profeſſe your ſelfe a Horſeman) you ſhall heerein finde ſufficient.</p>
               <p>After your Horſe is perfect in ſuch leſſons as haue beene formerlye remembred,
<note place="margin">Cariere.</note> and growen to his full and perfect ſtrength, hauing learned al his leſſons without ſwift gallop, and therein ſo ready as may be wiſhed, then beginne with him with a ſhort
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10570:118"/>Cariere, in a faire ſandie way, &amp; with a liuely voice put him forward, forcing him to runne ſwiftlye; roundly, &amp; ſmothely, with a ſteady head, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtop him ſelfe on his buttocks; then turne him on the left hand, &amp; ſoftly pace him to the other end of the Cariere path, and there ſtop him and turne him againe on the right hand, and ſo leaue. And as this paſſing a cariere or ſwift gallop, muſt neuer bee done or taught, vntill hee be moſte perfect in all the leſſons, ſo muſt it be done verie ſparingly, as once or twice in a month at the moſte, ſo ſhall hee doe all things with admiration, and of long continuance.</p>

               <p>Now you are not to teach your horſe either of theſe, vntil he be abſolutely perfect in thoſe former leſſons before mentioned, becauſe theſe leſſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, becauſe theſe leſſous are only lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſtopping &amp; aduancing, the which if he haue once perfectly &amp; long practiſed, then trot him for diuers daies vpon ſome hanging grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; vpon the

               <p>Firſt of purging, which may bee ſaide two-folde, outward &amp; inward: the time of purging or clenſing, the outward parts muſt be preſently after the taking of the horſe from Graſſe into the ſtable, which euer wold be at or before the feaſt of Saint Bartholmew, by reaſon of the great moiſtnes and colde that then vſually happen, &amp; to be taken vp very gently for fear of heating of him, leaſt his humors thereby ſhould be diſſolued by the veines and Arteries into euerie part of the body: and that euery horſe at ſuch times are ful of humors, appeareth in the beſt ſpirited hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if you then perceiue their actions, how lubburiſh and heauily they performe the ſame at ſuch times.</p>
               <p>The manner of purging or clearing the outward parts of the bodye, would bee in this manner: Firſt, ſheare his eares, and a little place behinde for the head-ſtall to lye flat and euen. Then take Sope, and annoint his head and iawes therewith, and then take warm Buck-lie, and waſh and clenſe the ſame in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part ſo cleane as is poſſible from all ſweate and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10570:129"/>ſcurffe, and preſently rubbe his head and euerie part with cleane linnen cloathes, and after with wollen cloathes verie drie: then put on his head a double whood or beggin made of purpoſe to keepe all the parts of his head verie warme: Then if it bee a faire warme day, in the Sunne, in like maner, waſh, purge and clenſe all his body and euerie part thereof, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his maine, taile and cods: then rubbe him and cleare him verie dry, and cloath him, and ſtuffe him verie warme, and giue him plenty of ſweet &amp; cleane litter: Then annoint all his hoofes, (hauing firſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them and made them dry with this oyntment: Take of Turpentine and ſheepe ſuet, halfe a pound of vnwrought waxe: a quarterne of Allom; of Sallet Oyle, halfe a pinte: of Tarre a quarter of a pinte: boile themll together vntill they be well incorporated, &amp; keepe it in a pot, and euerie day (his feet being clean) annoint his hoofes therewith: neither let him goe at graſſe (if he be a horſe of worth) aboue one moneth in the yeare, at any time after.</p>

               <p>The next day (if the ſigne be good) let him blood, if the blood be very bad, take from him tvvo quarts, if indifferent, but one quart; keepe him verie vvarme and with vvarme maſhes, in vvhich maſhes
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10570:130"/>(if poſſibly he will take it) put the powder of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Fenegreke, Turmericke, and of Enula campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, of each one ſpoonefull.</p>
               <p>The next day after (if the weather be faire) ride him very gently a mile, and ſo backe againe, and at his comming home, preſentlye haue him into the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cloath him ſo warme, as hee may ſweate, but not violentlye: and ſo faile not to ride him when hee is faſting euerie day moderately, a mile or two, vppon ſome pleaſant ground, and euerie day to ſweate a little for ſixe daies, and keepe him warme, and with warme water, and the Stable cloſe when he is in it.</p>
               <p>Hetherto you haue heard how to cleare him outwardly by waſhing, and inwardlye by purging, bleeding, and ſweating: and for vomiting take a great roote or two of Polipodium of the Oake cleane ſcraped, and laide all night in ſteepe in Spike oyle, tyed faſt to his bitte, and euerie morning faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let him bee ridden vvith it, and if hee haue anye colde or filth in his ſtomacke, it will force him to cough, and reare it from the ſtomacke; and by this means you ſhal be ſure to clenſe &amp; refine his blood, to exhauſt his watriſh humors, and to make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts cleane, ſo as with temperate order before preſcribed, you ſhall bee ſure to keepe him long, a ſound, perfect and ſeruiceable Horſe.</p>

               <p>The reaſons why the Horſe ſhould be thus clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and cleared after long reſt and full feeding, are, Firſt the pores of all the skinne being opened, the Horſe will eaſily ſweate, and therebye cleere the body from the vnperfect moiſture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it maketh the whole body to receiue Ayre, (which of it ſelfe is naturally moiſte) to helpe to coole the burning &amp; violent heate of the heart, and of the other members, when the Horſe doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as appeareth by the office of the lungs, which as a paire of bellowes dooth continuallye drawe freſh Ayre vnto the ſame, filling all the emptie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with moiſtnes, and therefore the Lungs, moſt principally ought to be kept cleere, to draw breath to coole the ſame, and that is the reaſon why Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are broken winded, becauſe the lungs are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to doe their office: and likewiſe the reaſon why broken winded Horſes when they are kept at drie meate, doe drawe their breath much more ſhorter, and with more violence then when they goe to Graſſe, becauſe graſſe is naturally colde and moiſt, and thereby his heart being more colde, the Horſe draweth his breath more at length: but if the Horſe be cleare, emptie, and ſound in the body, then doth he alwaies draw his breath alike, and ſo doth euery other creature alſo, from which ground of reaſon, three things may be collected &amp; obſerued. The firſt is, that the horſe head bee kept verie cleare from all obſtructions, (the which euermore commeth by colde) which greatlie hindereth drawing breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body: Secondly that the skinne of the Horſe be kept cleare and open to draw breath, at the pores
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10570:132"/>of the skinne into the body. Thirdlye, that <hi>Canales Pulmonis,</hi> the pipes or Canes of the Lungs, bee not opilated or ſtopped throgh viſcous fleame or tough humors like bird-lime, or with impoſtumation in the pipes, and ſo become putrified: euerie of which with continuance thereof, will deſtroy the horſe: &amp; there is no truth more apparant then that the cauſes of all theſe inward corruptions and infirmities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede onely from great reſt, full and foule feeding, and the diſtemperatures of heate and colde; &amp; that by the taking away of theſe cauſes, ſuch effects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow: ſo as you ſee the preſeruation of health and long life, is the moderate and temperate labour and exerciſe, the ſpare, cleane and ſweete foode, as hath bene formerly expreſſed.</p>

               <p>Sixtly, if your Horſe be very hot, let him not drinke colde vvater, but rather at ſome houſe and village giue him a quart of good beere, or a pinte of vvine, and if you doe vvater him by the vvay, let him not drinke vntill he haue vvaſhed his mouth, vvhich is done vvhen he thruſteth his head into the vvater, preſently pull vp his head, vvhich vvill clenſe his mouth, and let him drinke but little, although there be neceſſitie, and let it be fiue or ſixe miles from your Inne, and then ride him ſo as he may ſtill keepe the ſame heate he vvas in vvhen he did drinke, and vvhen you come to your Inne, dreſſe him cleane from ſvveat, and keepe him verye vvarme, and let him not eat vntill he be colde, and let it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him by little and little at a time, and after drinke if neede be.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, after his laboure, if you can haue a conuenient place, let him vvallovve himſelfe, for it dooth exceedingly comfort him, and giueth delight to his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſe of this perrilous diſeaſe, hath not bene truly foreopened by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not being truely vnderſtood, and therefore accounted of al Horſemen vncurable. And therefore as plainely as I can, I purpoſe to vnfolde the ſame, and I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the ſame into three kindes, euery of which may be truely tearmed a broken winde, becauſe the breath being drawne very ſhort and thicke, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to originall creation, the which is long colde, &amp; quiet, for ſo euery creature is by nature, but when any accident of violence of the body is vſed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, then euery mans experience telleth him that he panteth and fetcheth breath very ſhort and thicke, and therefore with the cauſe thereof I will begin, the which being vnderſtood, the effects can not be hid. Now the cauſes why a Horſe draweth his breath ſhort, may be many, as ſicknes, great ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or violent excerciſe: but the reaſon of the cauſe is, for that the heart being the onely hotteſt part of the body, from whence the Arteries and veines do carry the vitall heat into euery part of the bodie, (and therefore is truly ſaid to be the chariot of life) when the ſame by ſicknes, fulnes, or violence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe is choked and as it were ſmothered with great heate, then dooth the lights being the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10570:145"/>to draw breath, according to that office that nature hath ordeined them vnto, preſently labour with all violence to draw breath to coole and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the heart, and ſo conſequently all the other members and parts of the bodie, to fill all the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty corners with aire, which naturally and in predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate qualitie is moiſt: and when they haue drawn ſufficient breath, the drynes and heat by the moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the aire is quenched, the which being done, then dooth the creature draw breath leaſurely and coldely, and not before: but ſo long as the heart is oppreſſed with the violent heat of ſicknes, or by great fulnes, or violent excerciſe, the canes, pipes, and paſſages for breath, are almoſt ſtopped or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp, then dooth the lungs labour very extreame thicke, to preſerue the life of the creature, which is the heart, and therfore it is ſaide to be the firſt thing that liueth, and the laſt that dieth. And to make the ſame a little plainer, obſerue a Horſe that is broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded, (as the vſuall terme is) and you ſhall finde that he fetcheth his breath much more ſhorter when he is kept in the ſtable onely with die, meate, then when he goeth to graſſe, and the onely reaſon is, the coldenes of the moiſt food, which keepeth the heart and all the bodie in coldenes, becauſe the humors that come from the digeſtion of graſſe are colde and moiſt, according to the naturall qualitie of graſſe, and rawe hearbs. This rule being kept in minde, it is a truth apparant, that all thinges which hinder and ſtop the free paſſage of breath, breaking the naturall courſe thereof, are the onely cauſes of broken winde: ſo likewiſe the cure of broken winde
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10570:145"/>muſt be the remoouing of the ſtoppings of aire, &amp; then the lungs will perfectly do their office, &amp; then the creature is perfect from the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The differences of broken windes both in cauſe and effect are diuers, and yet may be truly tearmed broken, namely ſhortnes of breath, Purſicke, and broken winde.
<note place="margin">Shortnes of breath:</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt touching ſhortnes of breath, it may come by ſome groſſe &amp; tough humors, cleauing to the hollow places of the lungs, ſtopping the winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, ſo as the horſe cannot eaſely draw his breath: and the ſigne thereof is his coughing often, dayly, and vehemently, without voyding at the noſe or mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly it may come by haſty running after drinking, or vpon ful ſtomack, or by the diſſolution of ſome humors diſcending into his throate or lungs, by reaſon of ſome violent heat diſſoluing the ſame. And the ſignes therof are continual panting, ſending the ſame foorth very hot at his noſe, in a ſqueaſing manner, and his flanckes wil beat ſo thick as he cannot fetch breath, but by holding the neck right out and ſtraight, and this may truely be called broken winde, although in truth no broken winde.</p>

I haue often ſaid if the true cauſe of a diſeaſe be knowne, the diſeaſe it ſelf is eaſely cured. If any man of vnderſtanding thinke
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:10570:177"/>that by healing the place grieued, that the ſame is alwaies ſound &amp; whole, he is deceaued: for many times the ſudden healing or curing killeth the body or maketh that part which ſeemeth to be healed, to become of little vſe for the helpe of the body: for the mange, the leproſie, &amp; this diſeaſe of farcin, are in a Horſe eſpecially moſt pernicious, for often times it falleth out that many Horſes infected ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, though they liue, and the diſeaſe ſeemeth to be cured yet are of ſmall or no vſe: and as I haue elſewhere ſaide, that as God created <hi>Adam</hi> Lord of all his creatures, to rule, gouerne, preſerue, and haue the vſe of his creatures, the ſame right is diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Let vs then conſider of the vſe and practiſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe aſe: doth not euery mans experience and his own vnderſtanding (being his witnes) tel him, that when a young or old Horſe that hath long reſted, being taken vp from graſſe, that he is full and choked as it were with aboundance of humors? &amp; doth he think that when trauell diſperſeth thoſe humors, as it wil,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:10570:177"/>that theſe humors do not fly into the ayre, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the ſeueral parts of the body, and doth he think that the greatnes of humors being an enemy to nature, but that nature would expell them if ſhe could, or elſe keepe them from the heart, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of her life, and ſo leaue them to creepe out of the body in ſome of the outward parts thereof? or otherwiſe, if they cannot get out better to deſtroy that member then the whole body? &amp; doth not the continuall increaſe of humors, in the end by diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, become rulers &amp; predominate ouer nature, ſo as nature is enforced by their violence to yeeld her ſelfe to deſtruction? and doth not moſt men ride their Horſes vpon a full ſtomack, and cauſe nature againſt her will to digeſt the ſame vnnaturally, whereof many vnperfect humors are bred? &amp; doth not moſt men when their Horſes ſtand in the ſtable and reſt, giue him continually more then he can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, which alſo breedeth raw ſuperſluous humors? and doth not moſt men feed them in the ſtable with new, rawe, and greene foode, which naturally bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth obſtructions, and raw &amp; filthy humors? and do not moſt men when their Horſes are in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuffer them to reſt and feede full without mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate excerciſe? and do not moſt men when they trauell, their Horſe being very hot, ſuffer them to drinke their fill? &amp; do not moſtmen when their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come into the Inne very hot, the ſtomack the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt weake, ſuffer them then to eate, before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be able to digeſt?

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:10570:178"/>true cauſe of diſeaſes, when all theſe abuſes breede infinite cauſes of diſeaſe, without which no cure can perfectly be effected, yet where man cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly define, Reaſon leaueth him probaly to coniect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure: and therefore I coniecture the cauſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe to growe either from aboundance of bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which corrupt the blood, or from great diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emperature of the blood, by a violent heat into a ſudden colde, ſo as I haue gathered it onely to the corruption of the blood, for otherwiſe I doe not thinke that the bite of a Horſe or a lowſe could ſo poiſon the whole body, as to become lothſome to behold: &amp; therefore to the cure: firſt let him blood on both ſides of the necke, 3. quarts at leaſt, for it is moſt certaine that the liuer which is the fountaine of blood is corrupted, and ſo ſendeth the ſame into euery part of the bodie, then giue him this drinke; take a gallon of faire water, put into it a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Rue, a good ſpoonefull of Hempſeed, and a handfull of the inner rine of greene elder, bruſe them in a morter together, and ſeeth it till halfe be conſumed, and being colde, giue it him to drinke: euermore continue to let him blood in that veyne which is nigheſt to the ſore place, a great quantity, let his diet be thin, but very cleane and ſweete, viz. wheat ſtrawe, and dryed ſweete oates, a few at a time, then take this approoued medicine follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which although the diſeaſe be neuer ſo foule, it will vndoubtedly cure it.</p>

But beware of burning them, either with fire orother coroſiue, for although it may kill the vlcer, yet being diſperſed, it wil burn and ſcortch the Horſe skin, for burning doth purſe the skin, and maketh it run together, ſo as the Horſe wil neuer after proſper.
